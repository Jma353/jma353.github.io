title: Hello World

Welcome to the start of my blog!  In typical programming fashion, I'll leave you with the following:

{% highlight java %}

class Hello {

  public static void main (String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world"); 
  }

}

{% endhighlight %}


I will be populating this guide with opinions, guides, and other content in the coming weeks, so be on the lookout.
